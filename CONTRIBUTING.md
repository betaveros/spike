# Changes

Make any nontrivial changes on a feature branch, and create a pull
request on GitHub.  Pull requests should be reviewed by the maintainer
before being merged.  Ensure that your changes do not break the build or
tests.

ikdc <ikdc@mit.edu> is the current maintainer.

# Style

Ensure that neither `gofmt` nor `golint` complains about your code.  For
non-Go code, make sure it is well-formatted according to your best
judgment.  Please spell-check your comments.  In addition, try to wrap
lines of code to 80 characters.
